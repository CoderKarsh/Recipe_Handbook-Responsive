    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="textholder" id="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Break 6 to 7 slices of bread and add in a mixer or dry grinder.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Grind to a semi-fine consistency and do not make it floury or powdery. Place the bread crumbs in a plate or bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now rinse and steam 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium to large carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ to ½ cup green peas until they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, pan or instant pot. Once cooked strain the vegetables well. There should be no water or moisture in them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Peel and roughly chop the potatoes when warm. Also peel the cooked carrots and finely chop them and the french beans.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When the mashed potatoes cools down completely, add the chopped carrots and beans. Also add the steamed peas.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix everything well and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Then finely chop 1 medium sized onion and crush 4 to 5 garlic cloves, ½ inch ginger and 1 or 2 green chilies (hot peppers) into a paste. Set aside. You can crush them together or separately.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a pan. Add the ginger-garlic-green-chili paste. Sauté for some seconds till the raw aroma of ginger and garlic goes away.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the chopped onions.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir and sauté until the onion turns translucent or light brown.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add ½ teaspoon coriander powder, ½ teaspoon cumin powder, ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, ½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir and mix the ground spices with the rest of the mixture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Switch off the heat and then add the chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) or fresh parsley.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir very well and add this sautéed onion mixture to the mashed veggies.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add salt as per taste and 5 to 6 tablespoons of bread crumbs.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix very well. Set aside the patty mixture. Check the seasonings and add more salt and ground spices if required</li>
            <br>
            <li>Make the size of the veggie patties the same as the size of the buns. If the mixture looks soft or crumbles, then add some more breadcrumbs and mix everything again very well. Cover the veggie patties and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place 3 tablespoons Eggless Vegan Mayonnaise in a small mixing bowl. Add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds which have been crushed or powdered in a small spice grinder or mortar-pestle. Also add ½ teaspoon freshly crushed black pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add ½ to 1 tablespoon lemon juice. You can also add lemon juice as per your taste.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add ½ teaspoon apple cider vinegar or white vinegar and 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or olive oil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Season with ¼ to ½ teaspoon sugar. Add sugar as per taste. Add ⅛ teaspoon or 2 to 3 pinches of salt.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk the dressing very well. Set aside. Do check the taste and add salt, sugar, lemon juice if required.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Slice 1 small onion, 1 small tomato and 1 small cucumber thinly. Shred or chop 4 to 5 small lettuce leaves or blanched cabbage leaves. Cover and set these veggies aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a medium sized mixing bowl take 3 tablespoons maize flour, polenta or fine cornmeal, 3 tablespoons rice flour and 2 tablespoons gram flour (besan or chickpea flour).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add ½ cup water. Stir and mix everything to a smooth batter without any lumps. The batter should be of medium consistency.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Begin to heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil for pan frying the vegetable patties. When the oil becomes medium hot, dip the veggie patty in the batter.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Coat evenly with the batter. Place the batter coated veggie patty on the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <br>
            <li>edge the batter coated veggie patty evenly with the breadcrumbs. You can repeat the breading method twice for more crispiness.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the breadcrumb coated veggie patty in the medium hot oil. Batter coat another veggie patty in the same way and place it also in the pan.
                Depending on the size of your pan, you can fry from 2 to 4 patties. The veggie mixture makes 4 regular burger sized patties. </li>
            <br>
            <li> When the base is lightly browned or golden, then flip the veg patties.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Flip a couple of times until the patties are pan fried evenly and the crust becomes crisp and golden.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Drain the veggie patties on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Slice the burger buns in equal halves. Spread some butter on the burger bun slices.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat a small pan and toast the buttered side of the burger bun slice. For a vegan option, toast the burger bun with little oil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The buttered side should become lightly crisp and golden. Toast all the burger buns this way. If you want you can toast the second side too.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now spread the spiced mayonnaise dressing on the butter toasted side.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the vegetable patty on the bun.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Top up with sliced veggies like onion slices, tomato slices or cucumber slices.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spread some mayonnaise dressing on the second halve of the burger bun and top up with some shredded or chopped lettuce (which have been rinsed and then dried of all the moisture) or blanched cabbage leaves.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the burger buns on top of each other. You can also add grated cheese or a cheese slice for a cheese burger recipe.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Your veggie burger is ready. Assemble all veggie burgers this way.</li>
            <br>
            <li>. Serve these delicious homemade veggie burger immediately with some tomato ketchup or mustard sauce.</li>
