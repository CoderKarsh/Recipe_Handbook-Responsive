# Recipe_Handbook-Responsive
This is my first project using HTML+CSS

Replace the ('index-responsive.css' with 'index.css') inside (index.html) & ('recipes-responsive.css' with 'recipes.css') inside (burger.html, chowmein.html, kadhai paneer.html, salad.html) to see how the webpage looked like before I actively tried making it responsive
